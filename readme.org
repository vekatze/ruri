Ruri is a thin layer over mode-line. A thin layer that makes mode-line modular.

** Installation
Please use [[https://github.com/radian-software/straight.el][straight.el]] or something like that.

Then update the ~mode-line-format~ using the function ~ruri-install~:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(ruri-install
 '(modified size summary major-mode flycheck lsp encoding))
#+end_src

By default, segments are joined using 2 spaces; The separator can be customized via ~ruri-separator~.

** Defining Your Own Segments
*** Example
Let's see a toy example. The following code defines a new segment ~my-great-segment~ and uses it:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; shows current time using the face "error"
(define-ruri-segment my-great-segment
  (propertize (current-time-string) 'face 'error))

(ruri-install
 '(modified size summary major-mode encoding my-great-segment))
#+end_src

The code results in something like this:

You can easily see that the resulting string of ~my-great-segment~ is added to the mode-line.

*** Details
New segments can be defined using ~(define-ruri-segment NAME BODY)~. The ~NAME~ here is the name of the newly-defined segment, and the ~BODY~ is the body of a function that returns a (possibly propetrized) string. Using this ~BODY~, Ruri defines a nullary function ~(lambda () ,@BODY)~ with some appropriate name (~ruri--segment:my-great-segment~, in the case of the example above).

Defined segments can be added to the mode-line using ~ruri-install~. From the names of the segments passed to this function, Ruri finds corresponding renderer functions (e.g. ~ruri--segment:my-great-segment~), and calls it every time when mode-line needs to be updated. Ruri joins all the return values of these renderer functions, resulting a colorfully decorated mode-line.
